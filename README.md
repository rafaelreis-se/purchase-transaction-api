# Purchase Transaction API

A Go application for managing purchase transactions with multi-currency conversion support using Treasury exchange rates.

## Project Overview

This application was built to meet the following requirements:

- Store purchase transactions with validation
- Convert transactions to different currencies using Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange API
- Provide RESTful API endpoints for transaction management

## Technology Stack

After analyzing the project requirements, I chose the following packages:

### HTTP Framework

```bash
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

**Justification**: Gin is the most popular HTTP framework in Go, offering excellent performance, middleware support, and clean routing. Perfect for building production-ready REST APIs.

### Database & ORM

```bash
go get gorm.io/gorm
go get gorm.io/driver/sqlite
```

**Justification**:

- **GORM**: Industry standard ORM for Go, provides type-safe database operations and migration support
- **SQLite**: Meets the requirement of "fully functional without installing separate databases", while being production-ready and ACID compliant

### Testing

```bash
go get github.com/stretchr/testify
```

**Justification**: De facto standard for testing in Go. Provides assertions, test suites, and mocking capabilities essential for the required "functional automated testing for Production applications".

### Validation

```bash
go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
```

**Justification**: Robust validation library that integrates seamlessly with struct tags. Essential for validating transaction fields (description length, positive amounts, date formats).

### Configuration Management

```bash
go get github.com/spf13/viper
```

**Justification**: Popular configuration management library supporting multiple formats (JSON, YAML, ENV). Enables flexible configuration for different environments.

### UUID Generation

```bash
go get github.com/google/uuid
```

**Justification**: Google's UUID implementation provides cryptographically secure unique identifiers for transaction records, meeting the "unique identifier" requirement.

## üèó Architecture
